It's like tinder but for pair programmers! 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻💕


this is like one very unsecure way how people can do pair programming... but i still think it works.. but what is bad vibe

nice 

what makes this nice
    live
    user hosted - notebook env issues.
    google colab, this isway more live

what makes this not nice
    unsafe cause its kinda open 
    read only mode

there are security options

lowest tech prototype:
    pairmeup

1. like theres the tinder part. .. finding your code fuck buddy.. 
2. helping setting up the coding sesion ... setiting a remote coding session is esiest ... web version is even esier

goal 



notes from brainstorming:

pair programming:
list


## persona and mapping it to a user profile

2 programmers, in the profile:
    what do you have?

vscode liveshare ???? 


avoid all payments and sign ups


each list of projects -  has a list of interested people ( like a project) 

some are expert some are noob
but really you can code with anyone of them


# billion dollar idea parking space
 - watch the pros flow - live spectating feature (twitch but hardcore)
 - code with a pro for a donation (OnlyFans - stripe integration)
 - put pairmeup as a project on pairmeup (xp is stonk) credit anik
 - leaderboard (gamify?)
 - duolingo mascot that fucking stalks you 


TODO FOR NEXT MEETING
hard items: another mockup or code? 
lukas: project
hendrik: profiles

easyier items: ( lets try to get this into PR)
footer - hendrik
call to action on th landing page - lukas
